        1. $headers[] = 'Cookie: token=[ENTER TOKEN HERE]';

## Important notes for Sub-Systems
The entry-URL to Authenticate is https://URL-TO-LIAM3-Client/liam3_Client_login.php
This is important and has to be defined in every Sub-System.
For Example in the project SQMS, the config should look like this:
```
define('API_URL_LIAM', 'http://localhost/liam3-client/liam3_Client_login.php'); // URL from Authentication-Service -> returns a JWT-Token
define('AUTH_KEY', 'xxxxxxsecretkeyxxxxxx'); // Shared AuthKey which has to be known by the Authentication-Service
```
